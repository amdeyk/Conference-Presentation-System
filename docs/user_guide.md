# Conference Presentation System - Enhanced Features

I've implemented a comprehensive presentation management system with the following enhancements:

## 1. API Security & Remote Access

The system now includes robust security features for remote access:

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access using JSON Web Tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels for administrators, moderators, presenters, and viewers
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks and API abuse
- **CORS Support**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing for web clients
- **API Key Authentication**: Alternative authentication method for programmatic access
- **HTTPS Support**: TLS encryption for secure communications (configured in production)

## 2. Modular UI with Animations

The UI has been redesigned to be more modular and visually appealing:

- **Theme System**: Customizable themes with support for creating and switching between them
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theming using CSS custom properties
- **Animation Framework**: Smooth transitions and effects that can be enabled/disabled
- **Logo Customization**: Upload and position organizational logos on the display
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interfaces that work on any device
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Flexible positioning of UI elements

## 3. External Configuration

Configuration is now managed through a dedicated system:

- **Configuration File**: YAML/JSON configuration files for all system settings
- **Environment Variables**: Override settings using environment variables
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Configure the system via command-line options
- **Configuration UI**: Web interface for adjusting settings
- **Validation**: Schema-based configuration validation to prevent errors
- **Hot Reload**: Configuration changes without system restart

## 4. Multi-Device Support

The system now supports multiple device roles and integrations:

- **Role System**: Any device can be configured as Main, Backup, or Moderator
- **Device Discovery**: Automatic detection of compatible devices on the network
- **API-First Design**: All functionality accessible via HTTP API
- **WebRTC Integration**: Low-latency screen sharing between devices
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple communication channels for redundancy
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 5. Enhanced Security

Security has been enhanced throughout the system:

- **Password Hashing**: Secure storage of credentials
- **HTTPS Support**: Encrypted communications
- **Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks
